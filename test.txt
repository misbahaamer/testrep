Rename a table in SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

To rename a table in Azure SQL Data Warehouse or Parallel Data Warehouse, use the t-sql RENAME OBJECT statement.

 Caution

Think carefully before you rename a table. If existing queries, views, user-defined functions, stored procedures, or programs refer to that table, the name modification will make these objects invalid.

To rename a table, using:

SQL Server Management Studio

Transact-SQL

Before You Begin
Limitations and Restrictions
Renaming a table will not automatically rename references to that table. You must manually modify any objects that reference the renamed table. For example, if you rename a table and that table is referenced in a trigger, you must modify the trigger to reflect the new table name. Use sys.sql_expression_dependencies to list dependencies on the table before renaming it.

Security
Permissions
Requires ALTER permission on the table.

Using SQL Server Management Studio
To rename a table
In Object Explorer, right-click the table you want to rename and choose Design from the shortcut menu.

From the View menu, choose Properties.

In the field for the Name value in the Properties window, type a new name for the table.

To cancel this action, press the ESC key before leaving this field.

From the File menu choose Save table name.
